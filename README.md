# UAV UI Display (Thesis project)

This project is a proof-of-concept for a UAV UI display.
It is intended to be used with a cylindrical LED matrix display,
in combination with a gesture controlled autonomous UAV.
It was used with an Unreal Engine 5 simulator of a UAV in a search and rescue scenario.

## Project Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.13 is installed (other versions may work, but are not tested).
2. Inside the project directory, **create a virtual environment**:
	```
	python -m venv venv
	```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

	Windows:
	```
	venv\Scripts\activate
	```
	Linux/macOS:
	```
	source venv/bin/activate
	```
4. **Install dependencies**:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
